# Problem

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.

Example 1:

> **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2\
> **Output:** 6\
> **Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0,<ins>**1**,1,1,1,1,**1**</ins>]
> Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Example 2:

> **Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
> **Output:** 10
> **Explanation:** [0,0,<ins>1,1,**1**,**1**,1,1,**1**,1,1,1</ins>,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
> Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`

# Solution
Since the problem is to find "consecutive" ones, this means finding the valid subarray of this input `nums`. Thus, we can solve this using sliding window. In the problem, it states that "in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s". This means that at most `k` `0`'s can be in the subarray. So we keep track of the number of `0`'s in the subarray, and move the left pointer to the right if more than `k` `0`'s are in the subarray.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
